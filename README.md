# Object Detection Project :mag_right:

This is a Python-based project focused on real-time object detection using the YOLOv4 Tiny model. The project features an interactive user interface with clickable buttons, allowing users to select and track specific objects based on class names.

## Features :star:

- 📷 Real-time object detection using YOLOv4 Tiny model
- 🖱️ Interactive user interface with clickable buttons
- 🎯 Ability to select and track specific objects based on class names
- 📏 Automatic resizing of button lengths based on class name lengths
- 🔍 Display of detected object class names on the frame
- 🖱️ Option to click on buttons to enable/disable object detection for specific classes
- 🎨 Easy customization of button labels and appearance
- 💡 Supports detection of multiple objects simultaneously with color-coded frames
- 🖥️ Integration with OpenCV for video capture and frame processing

## Unique and Useful :trophy:

- 🚀 This project combines the power of YOLOv4 Tiny object detection model with an interactive user interface, providing a seamless and intuitive way to select and track specific objects in real-time.
- 📏 The dynamic resizing of button lengths based on class name lengths ensures optimal use of screen space and enhances the visual appeal of the user interface.
- 🖱️ The ability to enable/disable object detection for specific classes through button clicks offers fine-grained control over the detection process, allowing users to focus on objects of interest.
- 🎨 The project's modular design makes it easy to customize the button labels, appearance, and other aspects to suit different use cases and requirements.
- 📷 With its real-time object detection capabilities and user-friendly interface, this project is well-suited for a variety of applications, including surveillance systems, object tracking, and interactive computer vision projects.
- 💡 Each detected object is represented by a color-coded frame, allowing for easy visual identification and distinction between different objects.
